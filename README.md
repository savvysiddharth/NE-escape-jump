## Neuroevolution on Escape-jump

Setting up a neural network to play [escape-jump](https://github.com/savvysiddharth/escape-jump) game and then evolving that neural network using neuroevolution algorithm in order to train it.

Uses [mini-ANN-js](https://github.com/savvysiddharth/mini-ANN-js) neural network library for neuroevolution functions like mutate and crossover.

[See demo](https://savvysiddharth.github.io/NE-escape-jump/)
